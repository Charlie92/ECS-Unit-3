Collaboration Through GitHub
----------------------------

One of the primary features that makes GitHub so useful to developers is the ability to collaborate on a project with other developers and with their users. The primary mechanisms for collaboration are:

* __Issues:__ anybody can create an issue to point out a problem or make a suggestion. You could, for example, create an issue if you had a suggestion for a resource or for how to explain something more clearly.
* __Forks:__ by analogy to merge, a fork is when you make your own copy of a public repository so that you can adapt or modify it. If you wish to collaborate with someone on a project creating a fork is a very common starting point.
*__Pull Requests:__ if you've forked somone's code and now wish to share your changes with them, you can send them your changes by way of a pull request.

If you need to review these processes the [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) guide is a good place to start. If you have a local install of git the [Forking Projects](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) guide provides an introduction to forking and using the GitHub application.
