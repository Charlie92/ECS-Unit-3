Practicing With HTML
--------------------

Once you've got a basic site running, here are some first steps with HTML.

Your goal should be to know how to the following in HTML (don't worry about CSS or JavaScript yet):

* Construct the framework of a web page.
* Add headings
* Build lists
* Create a link
* Put an image on a page
* Mark up paragraphs

As you work on these things, also practice with GitHub, and test them on your GitHub web site.

## Try an "HTML 101" Tutorial

Here are some ones that I like:

* [HTMLDog](http://htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/) - the link is to their "beginner" tutorial, but there are several more there. Pick one that feels interesting, and like a good challenge.
* [W3Schools HTML5 Tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/htmL/) - W3 Schools is a great resource, well worth knowing about. See if you like their tutorial style, they have tutorials on most we subjects.
* [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web) - Code Academy is another very useful learning resource. This tutorial combines HTML and CSS.

## Go for a bigger challenge

If you know some basic HTML, or feel like a bigger project would be more your style. Here are some more challenging tutorials:

* [Lessmilk - HTML5 Games](http://www.lessmilk.com) - the author set himself the challenge of creating a game a week. He walks you through the process. You'll be learning JavaScript and HTML5.
