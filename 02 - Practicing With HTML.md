Practicing With HTML
--------------------

Once you've got a basic site running, here are some first steps with HTML.

Your goal should be to know how to the following in HTML (don't worry about CSS or JavaScript yet):

* Construct the framework of a web page.
* Add headings
* Build lists
* Create a link
* Put an image on a page
* Mark up paragraphs

As you work on these things, also practice with GitHub, and test them on your GitHub web site.

## Try an "HTML 101" Tutorial

Here are some ones that I like:

* [HTMLDog](http://htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/) - the link is to their "beginner" tutorial, but there are several more there. Pick one that feels interesting, and like a good challenge. The HTMLDog tutorials are "wordy" but develop examples that are relatively complete sites.
* [W3Schools HTML5 Tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/htmL/) - W3 Schools is a great resource, well worth knowing about. See if you like their tutorial style, they have tutorials on most we subjects. In contrast to HTMLDog the W3Schools tutorials are small hunks of code - you may find that they make it easier to see what is happening. If examples work better than explanations for you, you might perfer W3Schools.
* [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web) - Codecademy is another very useful learning resource. This tutorial combines HTML and CSS.

## Go for a bigger challenge

If you know some basic HTML, or feel like a bigger project would be more your style. Here are some more challenging tutorials:

* [Lessmilk - HTML5 Games](http://www.lessmilk.com) - the author set himself the challenge of creating a game a week. He walks you through the process. You'll be learning JavaScript and HTML5.
